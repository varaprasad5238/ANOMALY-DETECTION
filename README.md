# Efficient Data Stream Anomaly Detection

This repository contains the code and resources for my project titled Efficient Data Stream Anomaly Detection. The project aims to detect anomalies in a continuous data stream using various statistical and machine learning models. The approach involves handling seasonal variations, concept drift, and integrating multiple detection models in an ensemble or hybrid framework for improved accuracy.

# Project Overview

A complete project report has been uploaded as a PDF, which includes:
Introduction & Approach: Explanation of the problem, goals, and the detection methodology.
Methods: Detailed description of each detection model, including traditional statistical methods and more advanced machine learning techniques.
Results: Comparative analysis of the models with performance metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and ROC AUC.
References: Research and materials consulted during the project.

# Code Structure

Static Models
The following models are implemented as static methods in `staticmethods.py`:
Z-Score
KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)
IQR (Interquartile Range)
EMVG (Extended Moving Average with Seasonal Variation)
emvg.py: Implements the EMVG model, an extended version of the moving average, adapted to handle seasonal variations in the data.


# Visualization

visual.py: Handles the visualization of results and detection, including plotting data streams and marking anomalies.

# Hybrid Models

The hybrid model uses a combination of statistical and machine learning models to improve performance. The following files are included:
data_stream.py: Simulates or handles the data stream input for anomaly detection.
ensemble.py: Implements an ensemble approach to combine multiple detection models.
holt_winters.py: Uses the Holt-Winters method for seasonal trend handling.
hybridmain.py: Main script to execute the hybrid model.
isolation_forest.py: Implements Isolation Forest, a machine learning model for anomaly detection in streaming data.
visualization.py: Contains advanced visualization tools specific to the hybrid models.
z_score.py: Z-Score detection for the hybrid model.
